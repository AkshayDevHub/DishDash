        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Paneer Butter Masala—also known as Paneer Makhani—is one of the most beloved North Indian curries. Creamy, mildly spiced, and rich with buttery tomato gravy, it’s a vegetarian delight that rivals even the most indulgent meat-based curries. Often found on restaurant menus across India and globally, this dish is a favorite for everything from festive dinners to simple comfort meals.</p>
