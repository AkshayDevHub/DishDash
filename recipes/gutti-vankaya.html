            <li>Small purple brinjals – 10–12</li>

            <li>Handful of coriander leaves (chopped)</li>
            <li>Salt – to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>For the Curry:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Oil – 3–4 tbsp</li>
            <li>Mustard seeds – 1 tsp</li>
            <li>Curry leaves – 1 sprig</li>
            <li>Onion, finely chopped – 1 medium (optional, depending on regional variation)</li>
            <li>Water – as needed</li>
            <li>Coriander leaves – for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash the brinjals and remove stems.</li>
            <li>Make a "+" cut at the bottom of each brinjal, keeping them intact at the top (don’t cut all the way through).</li>
            <li>Soak in salted water for 10 minutes to remove bitterness (optional but recommended).</li>
            <li>Dry roast the following one by one until aromatic: Peanuts, sesame seeds, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, dry red chilies.</li>
            <li>Let them cool. Then grind them together with: Grated coconut, garlic, tamarind pulp, turmeric, and salt. Add very little water to make a thick, coarse paste.</li>
            <li>Gently stuff each brinjal with the prepared masala paste.</li>
            <li>Reserve the remaining masala (you'll use it in the curry).</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a wide pan.</li>
            <li>Add mustard seeds and let them splutter.</li>
            <li>Add curry leaves (and chopped onions if using), sauté until soft.</li>
            <li>Place the stuffed brinjals gently into the pan in a single layer.</li>
            <li>Sauté on medium flame for 5–7 minutes, turning gently to avoid breaking.</li>
            <li>Add the leftover stuffing paste and a splash of water (about ½ to 1 cup).</li>
            <li>Cover and cook on low heat for 15–20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until brinjals are tender and oil starts separating.</li>
            <li>Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><i>Serve hot with steamed rice or chapati.</i></p>
